# Healthcare Translation Web App with Generative AI

## Overview

This project is a web-based prototype that enables real-time, multilingual translation between patients and healthcare providers. The app converts spoken input into text, provides a live transcript, and offers a translated version with audio playback. Generative AI tools are used for translation, and the Web Speech API is leveraged for voice recognition.

## Features

- **Voice-to-Text:**  
  Converts spoken input to text using the Web Speech API, with AI enhancements for medical terminology.

- **Real-Time Translation:**  
  Translates the transcript using a generative AI tool (via the GROQ API), preserving numbers, units, and medical terms.

- **Audio Playback:**  
  Plays the translated text using the Speech Synthesis API via a "Speak" button.

- **Dual Transcript Display:**  
  Shows both the original transcript and the translated text side-by-side.

- **Language Selection:**  
  Allows users to select both input (source) and output (target) languages.

- **Data Privacy & Security:**  
  Sanitizes input to remove sensitive data; no patient data is stored.

- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:**  
  Optimized for both mobile and desktop usage.

```

> **Note:** Glossary JSON files are stored in **public/assets/**. For example, **public/assets/en.json** contains:
> ```json
> {
>   "medicalTerms": [
>     "hypertension",
>     "diabetes",
>     "myocardial infarction",
>     "hyperlipidemia",
>     "osteoporosis",
>     "gastroesophageal reflux",
>     "antibiotics",
>     "analgesics",
>     "anti-inflammatory",
>     "pulmonary embolism"
>   ]
> }
> ```
> and **public/assets/es.json** contains the corresponding Spanish translations.

## Setup & Local Development

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd healthcare-translation-web-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on platforms like **Vercel**.

### Deploying to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub:**  
   Ensure your project is committed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).

2. **Sign In to Vercel:**  
   Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in.

3. **Import Your Project:**  
   Click "New Project" and import your repository.

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**  
   Set your `GROQ_API_KEY` (and any other variables) in the Vercel dashboard under project settings.

5. **Deploy:**  
   Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app. Once deployed, you will receive a live URL (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`).

## Code Documentation

### Frontend

- **pages/index.tsx:**  
  - **Purpose:** The main page handles speech recognition, displays transcripts, enables language selection, and manages audio playback.
  - **Features:**  
    - Captures spoken input via the Web Speech API.
    - Displays the original and translated transcripts.
    - Provides buttons for initiating audio playback ("Speak") and stopping it.
    - Uses component-specific styles from `styles/style.module.css` and global styles from `styles/globals.css`.

- **styles/globals.css:**  
  Contains global CSS variables, resets, and base styles applied across the app.

- **styles/style.module.css:**  
  Contains local, component-specific styling (e.g., header, buttons, cards).

### Backend

- **pages/api/translate.ts:**  
  - **Purpose:** Processes translation requests.
  - **Process Flow:**
    1. **Sanitization:**  
       The `sanitizeInput` function removes sensitive information (e.g., patterns like "patient: <word>").
    2. **Pre-Processing:**  
       The `preProcessText` function scans the input text for medical terms (from the English glossary loaded from JSON) and replaces them with placeholders.
    3. **Translation:**  
       The `translateWithModel` function calls the GROQ API to translate the pre-processed text.
    4. **Post-Processing:**  
       The `postProcessText` function restores the original medical terms in the target language by replacing placeholders.
    5. **Validation:**  
       The `validateTranslation` function checks for discrepancies (dosages, anatomical terms, units) and generates warnings if needed.
  - **Glossary Management:**  
    - Glossaries are loaded from JSON files located in `public/assets/`.

## Data Privacy & Security

- **HTTPS:**  
  The application must be served over HTTPS for secure data transmission.

- **Secure API Keys:**  
  Sensitive keys (e.g., `GROQ_API_KEY`) are stored in environment variables and managed securely.

- **Input Sanitization:**  
  The `sanitizeInput` function removes sensitive patient information from the text before processing.

- **Minimal Data Storage:**  
  The application processes data temporarily and does not store patient data permanently.

- **Compliance:**  
  The app is designed with basic security measures. For production, consider further enhancements (e.g., audit trails, encryption at rest) to comply with HIPAA/GDPR.

## User Guide

1. **Voice Input:**
   - Tap the microphone button to start recording.
   - Speak clearly; the Web Speech API transcribes your speech in real time.
   - The original transcript appears on screen.

2. **Translation & Audio Playback:**
   - Once transcription is complete, the text is automatically sent for translation.
   - The translated text is displayed alongside the original transcript.
   - Tap the "Speak" button to listen to the translated text. Use "Stop" to cancel playback.

3. **Language Selection:**
   - Use the dropdown menus to select the input (source) and output (target) languages.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a robust yet rapid implementation of a healthcare translation web app using generative AI. It combines voice recognition, real-time translation, and audio playback within a secure, mobile-first design. For production, further enhancements in security and compliance are recommended.
